## What Did I Attempt To Build
In my hack-a-thing mini project, I attempted to build a version of the popular android game "Color Bump." Much of the project didn't involve actual code. The graphical elements were constructed in Unity. 

## What I Learned
This was my first time using working Unity3D and C#. Working through this hack-a-thing game me some knowledge and confidence in working with this technology. I was originally unaware that C# and Unity were used in tandem to create functional mobile / computer games. I am definitely interested in obtaining a better grasp of these technologies down the road. 

## What Didn't Work
I ran through several annoying bugs during this project which were time consuming. Unity has tons of moving components that take a lot of time to master, and having to learn a new language made it less intuitive (I used a tutorial, which is linked below). Installing the software took a while. I also downloaded Visual Studio rather than using Sublime text editor to make the coding process easier. Getting the code to interact with the Unity environment took some getting used to.
